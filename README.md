# Prodigy_DS_05
# Traffic Accident Analysis

This project is dedicated to analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns associated with road conditions, weather, and time of day. By leveraging data visualization techniques, we aim to identify accident hotspots and key contributing factors to traffic accidents.

- `src/`: Source code for the analysis.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for cleaning and preparing the data.
  - `pattern_analysis.py`: Script for analyzing patterns in accident data.
  - `hotspot_visualization.py`: Script for visualizing accident hotspots.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and reporting.
  - `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook for initial data exploration.
  - `Data_Visualization.ipynb`: Notebook for detailed visualization of data insights.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies for the project.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
